If downloading YouTube videos start to have errors and stop downloading, add a delay to the part before downloading or download the downloaded videos to local drive and start new download.

For testing on YouTube videos, make sure the directory as input is the directory where the test video is saved. Only test on one YouTube video at a time.

Change target_label in the parsing and saving video info part to 'doing nails' and run till the test set video download to download the 'doing nails' videos.
