The demo videos in Project10 are the most in-depth and go over the code and running the code.

Please watch Project10 videos first if you need a more in-depth demo.

All the code for each project are the same logic, may have very small differences which don't influence running the code, so how to run the code is about the same. Running the code should follow basically the same method which is carefully went over in Project10 demo videos.

Please refer to Project10 videos for running the code. Thanks.






In code on test on YouTube videos, only first 60s of video clips are downloaded and tested on. If you want, you may modify it to any number of seconds you want to test on. You'll need to modify the two ranges (in Download YouTube video part) to the number of seconds to test on and (in prediction on target part) the number of clips downloaded.
